 The Maply Quad Image Loader is for paging image pyramids local or remote.
 
 This layer pages image pyramids.  They can be local or remote, in any coordinate system Maply supports and you provide a MaplyTileSource conformant object to do the actual image tile fetching.
 
 You probably don't have to implement your own tile source.  Go look at the MaplyRemoteTileSource and MaplyMBTileSource objects, as well as MaplyMultiplexTileSource.  Those will do remote, local, and sources for animation respectively.  There's also MaplyWMSTileSource, but I wouldn't expect to use that.

 Set the image format for the texture atlases (thus the imagery).
 
 OpenGL ES offers us several image formats that are more efficient than 32 bit RGBA, but they're not always appropriate.  This property lets you choose one of them.  The 16 or 8 bit ones can save a huge amount of space and will work well for some imagery, most maps, and a lot of weather overlays.
 
 Be sure to set this at layer creation, it won't do anything later on.
 
 | Image Format | Description |
 |:-------------|:------------|
 | MaplyImageIntRGBA | 32 bit RGBA with 8 bits per channel.  The default. |
 | MaplyImageUShort565 | 16 bits with 5/6/5 for RGB and none for A. |
 | MaplyImageUShort4444 | 16 bits with 4 bits for each channel. |
 | MaplyImageUShort5551 | 16 bits with 5/5/5 bits for RGB and 1 bit for A. |
 | MaplyImageUByteRed | 8 bits, where we choose the R and ignore the rest. |
 | MaplyImageUByteGreen | 8 bits, where we choose the G and ignore the rest. |
 | MaplyImageUByteBlue | 8 bits, where we choose the B and ignore the rest. |
 | MaplyImageUByteAlpha | 8 bits, where we choose the A and ignore the rest. |
 | MaplyImageUByteRGB | 8 bits, where we average RGB for the value. |
 | MaplyImage4Layer8Bit | 32 bits, four channels of 8 bits each.  Just like MaplyImageIntRGBA, but a warning not to do anything too clever in sampling. |
